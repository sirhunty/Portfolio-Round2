          <p>
            Web Developer experienced in Agile development deliveries. I can
            successfully maintain front and back end existing code and create
            web applications. Within my last role, I successfully maintained
            multiple product account configurations and support channels for
            internal and external use. What motivates me as a web developer is
            to become a part of a team where I can utilize my knowledge and
            skills while learning from my peers. I have a Bachelorâ€™s in Graphic
            Design and earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the
            University of Arizona. Skills attained from this course are React,
            MySQL, and Node to name a few. I feel the combination of my
            technical expertise, passion to learn, and leadership experience
            makes me an advantageous candidate for any development team.
