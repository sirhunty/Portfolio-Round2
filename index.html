        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Web Developer experienced in Agile development deliveries. I can successfully maintain front and back end
          existing code and create web applications. Within my last role, I successfully maintained multiple product
          account configurations and support channels for internal and external use. What motivates me as a web
          developer is to become a part of a team where I can utilize my knowledge and skills while learning from my
          peers. I have a Bachelorâ€™s in Graphic Design and earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the
          University of Arizona. Skills attained from this course are React, MySQL, and Node to name a few. I feel the
          combination of my technical expertise, passion to learn, and leadership experience makes me an advantageous
          candidate for any development team.</p>
